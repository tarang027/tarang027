Hello and Welcome to my Hub! Myself, [Tarang Patel](https://hireasp.net/), a zealous Microsoft Certified full-stack developer and a freelance cross-platform engineer from india. My passion is to deliver the best outcome that meets client's requirements and industry standards within the promised timeframe. I pay the utmost attention to the technical journey, architecture, and code quality of the stuff I build.
